\frametitle{Computational Models of Language Acquisition}

Answers to the questions on language acquisition should eventually
come from neuroscience. But we seem to be far from this yet.

\begin{itemize}
\item Computational models can help us test claims of learnability 
      directly: we can use real the data (e.g. CHILDES database) and 
      empirical experiments with the models of language acquisition.
\item Computational models can help identify the innate knowledge 
      necessary (or not) for learning languages.
%\item Computational models may provide explanations on different
%      levels.
\item Computational models require theories to be described explicitly.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Answers should eventually come from neuroscience.
\item In the absence of detailed neurological knowledge, computational
models can provide:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Testing claims of learnability,
    \item Testing theories under various conditions,
    \item Help identifying the innate knowledge necessary (or not) for
          learning languages.
    \end{itemize}
\item Computational models can provide explanations on different
      levels.
\item Computational models require theories to be described explicitly.
\end{itemize}
