\frametitle{Computational Models of Language Acquisition}

Answers to the questions on language acquisition should eventually
come from neuroscience. But we seem to be far from this yet.

\begin{itemize}
\item Computational models can be used to test the validity of
      theories under various conditions.
\item Computational models require theories to be described explicitly.
\item Compared to other formal aproaches, computational simulations
      can benefit from using real data (e.g. CHILDES database).
\end{itemize}
