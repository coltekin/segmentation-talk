\begin{itemize}
\item We have a set of measures: TP, MI, SV, H, and reverse 
      versions of TP, SV, H.
\item These measures are similar, yet do not always indicate the same
      result.
\item All of the measures can be computed using a varying window size
      over the input sequence.
\item A certain measure calculated with different window sizes are
      expected to capture different linguistic generalizations.
\item We have an unsupervised procedure to guess boundaries: 
      peak (or valley) strategy.
\item We have a simple method to combine multiple decisions: majority
      voting.
\item We also have an evaluation scheme, given a gold standard, we can
      measure our success using precision and recall.
\end{itemize}
