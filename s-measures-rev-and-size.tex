\begin{itemize}
\item The assymmetric measures, TP, SV, H,  have their `reverse'
        counterparts.\\
      \begin{itemize}
      \item It may sound odd to predict the past (\xL), using the
            future (\xR), people seem to make use of this type or
            dependencies.
      \end{itemize}
\item The size of \xL{} and \xR{} in calculations matter.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \xL{} and \xR{} we use in calculation can be phonme 
      sequences of arbitrary size.
    \item Sequences of different sizes capture different linguistic
      generalizations.
    \end{itemize}
