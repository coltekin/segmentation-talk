\frametitle{Summary}

The segmentation procedure we have just reviewed
\begin{itemize}
\item is in line with the psycholinguistic research,
\item is completely unsupervised,
\item is incremental,
\item performs competitive with an alternative state 
      of the art segmentation method.
\end{itemize}

This is only the part of the solution, we can
\begin{itemize}
\item use information from utterance boundaries,
\item keep an explicit lexicon and use it for further segmentation,
\item make use of acoustic cues,
\item use a better algorithm for boundary guessing.
\end{itemize}
