\frametitle{Difficulties of learning segmentation}

\begin{itemize}
\item No clear acouistic markers in fluent speech.
\item Large speaker variation in acoustic input.
\item Noise in the environmet.
\item Children has to start with no knwledge of words.
\item Even with a comprehensive knowledge of words, segmentation is
      still difficult because of multiple plausible segmentations. For
      example:\\
      \texttt{/6go/}:  \texttt{/6go/} `ago' or \texttt{/6 go/} `a go'?\\
      \texttt{/Itsnoz/}: \texttt{/Its noz/} ‘its nose’ or \texttt{/It snoz/} ‘it snows’?
\end{itemize}
