Children very early in life (8-months) seem to be sensitive to this
type of information in the speech (Saffran, Aslin, Newport 1996)

\begin{itemize}
\item Infants are habituated to artificial speech segments built from a simple
    vocabulary.
\item They are tested with non-familiar patterns and familiar
      patterns.
\item On the basis of very short training 8-month-old infants attended
      familiar examples significantly longer than the unfamiliar ones.  
\end{itemize}
