\frametitle{Computational Models for Language Acquisition}
Computational models of human language acquisition has to meet some
criteria that is not always applicable for engineering oriented
CL applications.
\begin{itemize}
\item Modes should use realistic input, such as naturally 
      occurring child directed speech. 
\item Any additional source of information, or heuristics should be
      justifiable.
\item Learning should proceed on-line: models should not require all
      the input data available at once.
\item Models should not pose unrealistic bounds on memory and
      computation resources.
\item The assumptions and predictions of the model should match (at
      least should not conflict with) psycholinguistic evidence.
\end{itemize}
